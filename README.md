## Summary 

The percentage of five star reviews for vine users is only 41% where as for non users its at 53%. Which does not show a positivy bias towards reviews in the vine program. One reason for that is a larger amonut of non users vs users. Additionally we could analyse the statistical distribution (mean, median and mode) of the star rating for the Vine and non-Vine reviews.
